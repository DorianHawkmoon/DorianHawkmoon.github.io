							<h1 class="major">Madden 21 - 22 - 23 - 24</h1>
							<p>During my time at EA I worked mainly in four titles of Madden, specifically the UI part of My Avatar team, that focused in Yard and everything around the progression and customization of the player's avatar.</p>
<p>I've been involved in all the project phases, from writing TDDs including breakdown and estimation of tasks, implementing them during production and bug fixing after and before launching the game to the market. All of it involving conversations with all teams (QA, designers, other teams of the game, managers...)</p>

							<p>My first year I was tasked with a prototype of the Store, one of the main features of that year, from a given TDD and later the final implementation of it.
							I also was in charge of implementing the purchase of soft and hard coin and its flow in the game, including the Store and customization links, linking to the first party points.
							And together with the rest of the team I was also involved in the customization screens.</p>

							<br>
							<p>Next year I took responsibility on the profile feature, which is the following screen we can open almost anywhere and includes several tabs with other screens, by writing the TDD and taking care of all the details surrounding the feature such as:
<ul>
<li>The new profile screen</li>
<li>Implementing a framework so we could include any type of screen we want to the profile and deal with the details.</li>
<li>Navigation from and to different places in the game, including navigation loops.</li>
<li>The scene behind the screen, as some places uses a 3D scene with the avatar, and others a background, while the profile itself is an overlay for the whole game, so we needed to take it into account.</li>
<li>Adaptation of the objectives screen to be part of the profile.</li>
<li>Online and offline situations</li>
</ul>
Together with the profile, I kept working on parts of the store and customization screen, a popup for customizing the loadout preview in main menu, and creation of the avatar, rewards, dynamic message to be sent in live.
